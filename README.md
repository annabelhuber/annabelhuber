A brief synopsis of projects in my portfolio:
* ## BlackJack
  - Done for a class, I used Java to simulate a random game of Blackjack and log the results, which was then ran 1000 times in order to see the distribution of results and test if the house really does always win, even without any kind of unfair advantage
* ## Edge Detection
  - This code was generated using concepts and equation based in Numerical Analysis. Two different methods (the Gradient Method and Heissian Matrices) were coded and compared in their ability to accurately take an image and find the "edges" i.e. the borders of objects in the photo. This project was later used in a poster, which is linked in the README of that project.
* ## Closet Sorting
  - This project is currently in the works and is 1) a way for me to work with GUIs in Java in more depth and 2) something that would make my everyday life easier. The concept is to be able to log in all of my clothing so that I can pick out outfits, know where all of my clothing is stored, search my inventory for specific attributes, etc.
